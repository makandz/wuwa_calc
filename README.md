# wuwa_calc

A Wuthering Waves damage calculator. Pure TypeScript, no framework, no bundler — `tsc` compiles
everything under `src/` into `dist/`, mirrored one level deeper (`src/engine/gear.ts` →
`dist/src/engine/gear.js`).

```
python dev.py                  # compilers + server; then http://127.0.0.1:8731/index.html
npm run build                  # tsc into dist/src/, then esbuild into dist/bundle/
npm run precompute             # solve every team, write dist/solves/ for the published site
npx tsc --noEmit               # just typecheck
npm test                      # cost preset regression checks, after npm run build
```

Has to be served, not opened off disk — browsers block module imports on `file://` URLs. Use
`127.0.0.1`, not `localhost`: the server binds IPv4 only, and on Windows `localhost` tries IPv6
first and stalls ~200ms on *every* connection.

The default Team Cost is **Makan's costs**. Four-star characters use S6, Verina uses S2,
and unlisted five-stars and Rovers use S0. Characters use their configured standard or
4-star weapon unless overridden. R0 means no
signature weapon; weapons configured at a fixed refinement retain that rank. The
per-character exceptions live in `src/costs.ts`; Denia uses Stringmaster R1 in both modes.
Opening a comparison still shows alternative sequences or weapons. Shared links explicitly
include the selected cost preset, and the original presets remain available.
Rotations that require higher sequences or cannot meet energy or Crit Rate requirements are
omitted from this preset. This includes Jianxin's S2 rotation and Roccia's S6-only variant.

The main screen's **Only characters I own** checkbox limits teams and character search to
Makan's roster. The preference is saved locally and applies with any Team Cost preset.
Edit the limited-character list in `src/ownership.ts`; standard characters, four-stars and
Rovers are included automatically. Existing character filters still apply, and an owned
support takes the place of an unowned default support within each interchangeable group.

## The engine

A `Gear` is anything equippable that can react to actions: `Buff`, `Debuff`, `Talent`,
`Inherent`, `Sequence`, `ResonanceMode`, `Weapon`, `Mainslot`, `Sonata`/`Sonata3pc`/`Sonata1pc`/`Sonata2pc`, `Action`,
and `Resonator` itself — all plain subclasses, nothing added. A `Resonator` is just a `Gear`
that also carries element/weapon type/base stats/`maxEnergy`/color.

```ts
export const THRENODIAN_LEVIATHAN = new Mainslot({
  name: "Reminiscence: Threnodian - Leviathan",
  action: ACTION_THRENODIAN_LEVIATHAN,
  stats: [[Stat.DmgBonus, 12, Attribute.Havoc], [Stat.DmgBonus, 12, Type1.Liberation]],
});
```

Most gear is declared as data and compiled into the hooks below (`gear.ts`): `stats` (flat lines;
on a `Buff` they pay while held, `perStack`, gated by `when`, `early` to pay in `updateBuffs`),
`until: "outro" | "swap" | "afterSwap"` (when a Buff is revoked), and `grants` (`{ on, buff, stacks,
to }` — a trigger from `context.ts`'s `onCast`/`onType`/`onInflict`/`onApplied`/`either`/`both`,
the Buff to grant — the declaring Buff itself when left out, or a thunk for one declared further
down — and `to: "team" | "enemy" | "next"` for a team buff, a debuff, or an outro handoff).
Whatever the form doesn't fit stays a closure on one of these hooks, which run at different points
in `evaluate()`, for whichever Gear is actually held (locally, globally, or on the enemy) when an
action resolves. In order:

- `combatStart` — once, at `equip()` time, never mid-fight (a resonator's own base stats).
- `updateDebuffs` — what this cast *inflicts* (a Negative Status, a Shifting, the shield/heal
  markers), first of all so everything downstream can see it.
- `updateGlobal` — runs for every slot's own held gear on every action, `currentSlot` switched to
  that gear's own holder — how a self-held buff reacts to a *teammate's* action without being
  promoted to a real team-wide buff.
- `updateBuffs` — grant/revoke/queue/spend for the acting slot's own gear. Never a stat.
- `constantStats` — flat, unconditional contributions (cached per action tag word).
- `applyStats` — conditional stat contributions, `addStat(stat, value, tag?)`.
- `convertStats` / `lateConvertStats` — for a buff that reads a value some other gear's own
  `applyStats()` just produced (an HP fold, a threshold check against a running total).
  `lateConvertStats` runs a phase later again, for a conversion that would otherwise race another
  gear's `convertStats()`.
- `afterAction` — cleanup once the row is resolved.

`addStat`'s optional third argument scopes it to an attribute or damage type (`Type1`/`Type2`) —
the running totals sum both the bare and the matching scoped entries for whatever action is
resolving. `node`/`cast`/`scaling` never participate in scoping. A debuff that changes the
*enemy's* own stat (Res Reduce, Def Reduce) uses `addEnemyStat()` instead.

Grants come in one flavour per pool: `applyCurrent`/`revokeSelf` (this slot),
`applyTeam`/`revokeTeam` (team-wide), `applyEnemy`/`revokeEnemy` (on the target),
plus `addBuff(resonator, …)` to pay out onto one specific member regardless of whose turn it is.

## Actions

```ts
const Intro = chisaAction("Intro - Reverberance - Return", {
  node: Node.Intro, cast: Cast.Intro, type: Type1.Intro,
  mv: 95.43, energy: 10, concerto: 10, offtune: 6400, forte1: 20,
});
```

`mv`/`energy`/`concerto`/`offtune`/`forte1`-`forte5` are the action's own declared baseline,
banked automatically every time it resolves — a kit never mutates its own running total or
gauge directly from an action, and a forte delta goes on the action rather than through a manual
set call. A buff that needs to contribute *on top* of the declared amount (a proc, a conditional
refund) does it through `Stat.AddEnergy`/`AddConcerto`/`AddOfftune`/`AddForte1`-`5`, so the
contribution still traces back to whichever buff granted it.

`active: false` marks a cast that doesn't hold the field (an outro, an off-field follow-up), which
is what every "lost on switching out" buff keys off via `lostOnSwap()`. `resetEnergy` marks the
real button-press Liberation that spends the bar.

`queue(action)`/`queueOn(resonator, action)` splice a follow-up in directly after the current
one; `queueEvent(action)` puts an engine-level event (a Tune Break) ahead of them, unpinned;
`queueOutro(buff)` hands a buff to whoever the outro queue delivers it to next.

## Rotations

A rotation is up to three *action chains* — one per way of arriving on field — written as a
single flat array that `Rotation`'s constructor splits apart on its markers:

```ts
new Rotation([
  START_COMBAT_NON_OPENER, Skill, START_COMBAT_NON_OPENER,  // the fight's own first seconds
  OPENER, BA1, BA2,                                         // leading the team, no Intro to cast
  INTRO, Liberation, ECHO_OUTRO, OUTRO_NEXT,                 // every visit after
]);
```

The `OPENER` chain runs *through* the `INTRO` marker without casting it and carries on into the
same tail, so the body a resonator repeats is written once. `INTRO`/`ECHO_ONFIELD`/`ECHO_OUTRO`/`ECHO_CANCEL` resolve at run
time against whatever the acting slot actually has equipped; `OUTRO_NEXT`/`OUTRO_LAST` choose
which way the field is handed on. Only slot 1 can use an `OPENER`.

Every rotation must reach 100 concerto, or its outro can't fire.

## Conventions

- Forte gauges (`forte1()`-`forte5()`) have no floor or ceiling of their own — a kit clamps its
  own real bounds itself (`setForte1`…) only where the mechanic actually needs one.
- A short window (≤20s): a self buff is lost after the outro action gains stats (checked in
  `convertStats()`, after `applyStats()` has already paid out); a team buff is lost on the
  applier's own next intro. A window ≥21s is permanent uptime once granted, never revoked. A
  buff whose text says "lost on swap" is checked with `lostOnSwap()` in `updateBuffs()` instead.
- Flat, unconditional equipment stats go in `stats: [...]`; anything conditional stays in
  `applyStats`.
- ICD-gated passives ("triggers once every 0.5s") fire on every qualifying action instead —
  there's no real-time clock here.
- A live per-hit ramp that only makes sense against real-time state this engine doesn't track
  (a trigger tied to a teammate's own unspecified cast rate, a per-hit stacking buff inside an
  already-lumped multi-hit window) is left undocumented as a no-op rather than approximated —
  flagged in the file, not guessed at.
- A resonator's own file is ordered actions, then buffs/talent/inherents/sequences, then the
  `Resonator` itself, then its talent-tree bonus, then a sample rotation, then its loadout(s).
- How much of a resonance chain a build holds is set by the resonator's own `tier` (stats.ts's
  own `Tier`, turned into a level by gear.ts's `baseSequence()`): `Tier.Limited` (the default, a
  banner-only 5-star) is costed at S0, `Tier.Standard` (Encore, Jianxin, Verina) at S2, and
  `Tier.Free` (4-stars and the Rovers) at S6, their whole chain. For the first two that level is a baseline, not a ceiling —
  with that role's Sequences box open every level from it up to S6 gets a row of its own — so a
  kit above S0 declares its nodes as a `sequences` list of `Sequence` pieces, sliced to the level
  a row runs at.

## Adding a resonator

One file in the resonator's own region folder (`src/resonators/v<patch><region>/`). nanoka.cc is
the source of truth; cite the character page in the file header, and where a gauge isn't exposed
there, note the fallback used. Never invent a missing forte value.

Export the `Loadout` as the resonator's bare name (`LUPA`; a mode variant as `LYNAE_RUPTURE`), the
`Resonator` itself as `LUPA_RESONATOR` — a `Loadout` names the resonator, its talent, both inherents, every viable
weapon (best signature first, best standard second), the `EchoLoadout` options, the main-stat
builds, a substat spread, and the `Rotation`. Then register it in `src/teams.ts`: add it
to `LOADOUTS` (which is also how a Worker resolves a team it was handed by name) and, once it has
a team to run in, to `TEAMS`. A fully-ported resonator with no team yet is normal, not a stub.

`RESONATORS.md` tracks who is still unimplemented.
