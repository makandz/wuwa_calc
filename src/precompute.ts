/**
 * Solve the roster offline into `dist/solves/` (one file per state plus index.json), so the published
 * site opens onto a full table. Run after the bundle: the stamp is a hash of dist/bundle/, and a
 * stamp that doesn't match the running page means the files are ignored. Fan-out is
 * worker_threads over this same file. Only one box is open per state on purpose — rows are the
 * cross of every open axis. Row counts: default 486 | sequences 3.5k | echoes 4.8k | weapons 9.7k.
 *
 * Every key is solved once; where two states ask for the same key it is solved and written by
 * whichever reaches it first, and `index.json` sends a state to each file its own keys landed in.
 *
 *     npm run build && npm run precompute
